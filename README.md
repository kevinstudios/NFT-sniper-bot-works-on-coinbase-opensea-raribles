This is the JavaScript NFT Sniper that works on OpenSea, CoinbaseNFT and Raribles. Of course it's open source easy to read easy to modify if you still wish to do so even though the way it is it's very effective.

I created a YouTube channel for tutorial on how to configure this and run it properly you can watch it here
